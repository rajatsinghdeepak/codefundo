# Project - 

To take use of number of mobile devices connected to a base station(inside its cell). We can generate visual representation of this statistics like heat map when a natural calamity occurs.



# Why -

After a natural disaster occurs the main concern for disaster management team is to make plan for relief operations but due to lack of information like where the survivors are or headed to its very difficult to make an efficient one so the brute force method is applied which can cost many lives. Here my proposed method can be effective because during initial hours all the mobile will have power so they will be connected to mobile towers.

# Working

Every mobile is connected to its nearest base station. As every telecommunication operators know that how many devices are connected to a cell tower they can provide number of users wrt a particular cell(area covered by a BTS).Also we will take use of roaming feature ie. when an user shift from on cell to another. When a natural disaster like tsunami occurs we can generate the shift in heat map(Number of users in a cell on a real geographical map) following the timeline of disaster to see where the population is going.

# How will i try to apply

I am planning to build a website which will have Heat maps with respect to the disasterâ€™s time frame and to respect the privacy, data will be displayed only for adequate time frame(eg. 2 days before tsunami and 1 month after it)

# Comparison with GPS

  * We are looking for disaster management in rural areas also where someone might not be having a device with GPS eventually decreasing the sample size.

  * Also GPS drains battery way more faster which is not feasible in this kind of situation.
